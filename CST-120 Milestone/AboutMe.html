    <p>
        I am a 27 year old father, fiance, and student. I have a 4 month old daughter 
        named Hope (I call her Hopie), the love of my life, Erica, and two dogs I 
        found at 6 weeks old in an abandoned field who are now over 1 year old named 
        Shadow and Lily. I have been in college since 2015, I started at ITT Technical 
        Institute and was 2 months from obtaining my Associates degree when every ITT 
        in America shut down. I then transferred to GCU where I still attend. I have
         taken a few breaks throughout my academic career but I've always remained 
         focused and returned to school.
